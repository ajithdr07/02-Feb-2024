## Functions

**1. Sum of Two Numbers:**

Write a function that takes two parameters, a and b, and returns their sum.

**2. Check for Even or Odd:**

Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns whether it is even or odd.

**Reverse a String:**

Implement a function that takes a string as input and returns the reversed version of that string.

**Calculate Square:**

Write a function that calculates the square of a given number.

**Concatenate Strings:**

Create a function that takes two strings as parameters and returns their concatenation.

**Check for Palindrome:**

Implement a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome.

**Calculate Factorial:**

Write a function to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer.

**Maximum of Two Numbers:**

Create a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns the larger of the two.

**Greet a Person:**

Write a function that takes a person's name as a parameter and returns a greeting message.

**Calculate Average:**

Implement a function that takes an array of numbers and returns their average.

## Higher Order Functions

**1. Implement forEach:**

Write a function myForEach that takes an array and a callback function and performs the same action as the forEach method.

**2. Implement map:**

Create a function myMap that takes an array and a callback function and returns a new array with the results of applying the callback to each element.

**3. Implement filter:**

Write a function myFilter that takes an array and a callback function and returns a new array containing only the elements that satisfy the callback condition.

**4. Implement reduce:**

Create a function myReduce that takes an array, a callback function, and an initial value, and applies the callback function to reduce the array to a single value.

**5. Function Composition:**

Implement a function compose that takes two functions and returns a new function that is the composition of the two.

**6. Chaining Functions:**

Implement a function chainFunctions that takes an array of functions and returns a new function that chains the functions together, passing the result of each as the argument to the next.

**7. Higher-Order Function Practice:**

Given an array of numbers, use higher-order functions to find the sum of squares of only the even numbers.

**8. Custom Map and Filter:**

Write a function customMap and customFilter that behave similarly to the built-in map and filter functions.
